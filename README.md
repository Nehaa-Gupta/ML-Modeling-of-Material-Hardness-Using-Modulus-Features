ML-Modeling-of-Material-Hardness-Using-Modulus-Features

This project focused on using machine learning to predict material hardness based on modulus features such as bulk, shear, Young's modulus, and Poisson's Ratio. The project involved two key phases: regression modeling and classification modeling. In the regression phase, multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, were applied to predict experimental hardness values (Hexp), with performance evaluated using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE. The second phase involved predicting the most suitable constitutive equation for hardness using classification models, including artificial neural networks (ANNs). Hyperparameter tuning was conducted for the ANN models, with four combinations tested to identify the best-performing model. This comprehensive analysis enabled the identification of the most accurate models and equations for predicting material hardness, providing valuable insights for material science applications.
